# Analisis-Sentimen-Twitter-Layanan-Telekomunikasi-Indonesia-Menggunakan-Algoritma-LSTM
This Program aims to analyze the public's opinions on film reviews based on Twitter using the LSTM algorithm. By processing tweet data, this project can identify positive and negative sentiments from film reviews in the tweets. The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, LSTM modeling, training the model using labeled sentiment data, and evaluating the model's performance. After going through these stages, the model will be able to classify the sentiment of new tweets and generate outputs indicating whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
